## Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness

>Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.

My old roommate Imran recommended this. Cephalopods, like octopus and cuttlefish, display a lot of super interesting behavior. They have skin that changes color to camougflage them. 

Mostly I read these books because I enjoy biology facts but it's interesting to contrast evolution with engineering design. The majority of cephalopods only live to be a couple years old and he goes through hypothesizing why this might be.
