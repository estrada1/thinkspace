### Trying to code real good

One of my goals during my break was to take on some personal coding projects. One of those was to improve my use of GitHub, a hosting service used to manage and version control code. This blog is my excuse! It uses Jekyll, a framework for making blogs from the same creators as GitHub, and is hosted on GitHub site. 

Going to Switzerland and travelling a bit during my post-PhD break, it would be nice to sum up my experiences and share them with family. I hope to keep a few, dedicated readers updated, at least through the transition! Putting up a tidy blog also soothes an urge to organize things. Sometimes I will write thoughts on books I've been reading so I don't forget immediately afterwards.
